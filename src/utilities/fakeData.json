It does not take a lot of space (in comparison to a full rack), it’s usually cheaper, but you can’t do as many different exercises with it as you can with a full rack. Usually, it’s meant for squats and pull-ups. While power (full) rack can also be used for squats, I felt obligated to separate the two.",
